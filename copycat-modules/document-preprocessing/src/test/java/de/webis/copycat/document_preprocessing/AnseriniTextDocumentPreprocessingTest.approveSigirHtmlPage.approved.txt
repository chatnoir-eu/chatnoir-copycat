task designs implemented at evaluation forums labelled datasets for machine learning software tools and services for information retrieval and access and software tools and services for evaluating and analyzing information retrieval and access systems review criteria authors should be aware that the resource paper track will use a set of review criteria that is different from the regular full and short papers this is outlined below novelty what is new about this resource does the resource represent an incremental advance or something more dramatic availability is the resource available to the reviewer at the time of review are there discrepancies between what is described and what is available are the licensing terms of use sufficiently open as to allow most academic and industry researchers access to the resource if the resource is data collected from people do appropriate human subjects control board procedures appear to have been followed utility is the resource well documented what level of expertise do you expect is required to make use of the resource are there tutorials or examples do they resemble actual uses or are they toy examples if the resource is data are appropriate tools provided for loading that data if the resource is data are the provenance source preprocessing cleaning aggregation stages clearly documented predicted impact what ir research activity is enabled by the availability of this resource does the resource advance a well established research area or a brand new one do you expect that this resource will be useful for a long time or will it need to be curated or updated if the latter is that planned how large is the anticipated research user community will that grow or shrink in the next few years submission guidelines resource papers must describe original work that has not been previously published not accepted for publication elsewhere and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference submissions of resource research papers must be in english in pdf format and be at most 6 pages including figures in length unrestricted space for references in the current acm two

requirements or are plagiarized are subject to desk rejection by the chairs it is also not permitted to double submit the content to both resource track and other track s of sigir 2021 e.g a resource paper for building dataset a and a full paper containing the construction process of dataset a in the experiment section to support identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest the full author list must be specified at submission time authors should note that changes to the author list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the pc chairs resource paper
