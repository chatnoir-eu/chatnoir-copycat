# CopyCat: Near-Duplicate Detection for Web Crawls

## Pipeline

ToDo: Easy to use examples: I only have git + docker, and then I can run the following near-duplicate detection on corpora on my local machine (inspired by capreolus).


1. Create Document representations
   - Example: `make new-doc-representation-on-small-sample`

2. Create SimHash Deduplication Jobs
   - Explain this after creation of document representations is easy to run on a local machine
