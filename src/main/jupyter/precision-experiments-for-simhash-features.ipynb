(March 2009) Benedict XII Papacy began December 20, 1334 Papacy ended April 25, 1342 Predecessor John XXII Successor Clement VI Birth name Jacques Fournier Born ca. 1280s Saverdun, France Died April 25, 1342 Avignon, France Other popes named Benedict Papal styles of Pope Benedict XII Reference style His Holiness Spoken style Your Holiness Religious style Holy Father Posthumous style None Pope Benedict XII (died April 24, 1342), born Jacques Fournier, was Pope from 1334 to 1342. Contents 1 Life 2 Fournier\\'s Accession to the Papacy 3 Papal numbering 4 References [edit] Life Little is known of the origins of Jacques Fournier. He is believed to have been born in Saverdun in the Comt�� de Foix around the 1280s to a family of modest means. He became a Cistercian monk and left to study at the University of Paris. In 1311 he was made Abbot of Fontfroide Abbey and quickly became known for his intelligence and organizational ability. In 1317 he was made bishop of Pamiers. There he undertook a rigorous hunt for Cathar heretics, which won him praise from religious authorities, but alienated the local people. His efforts against the Cathars of Montaillou in the Ari��ge, were carefully recorded in the Fournier Register which he took to Rome and deposited in the Vatican Library. This has been documented by Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie\\'s pioneering microhistory, Montaillou, village occitan. In 1326, upon the successful rooting out of the last - it was believed - heretics of the south, he was made Bishop of Mirepoix in the Ari��ge. A year later, in 1327, he was made a cardinal. [edit] Fournier\\'s Accession to the Papacy Fournier succeeded Pope John XXII (1316���34) as Pope in 1334, being elected on the first conclave ballot. But he did not carry out the policy of his predecessor. He practically made peace with the Emperor Louis IV, and as far as possible came to terms with the Franciscans, who were then at odds with the Roman See. Benedict XII was a reforming pope who tried to curb the luxuries of the monastic orders, though without much success. He also ordered the construction of the Palais des Papes in Avignon. He spent most of his time working on questions of theology. He rejected many of the ideas developed by John XXII. In this regard, he promulgated a papal bull, \\\\\"Benedictus Deus\\\\\". This dogma defined the Church\\'s belief that the souls of the departed go to their eternal reward immediately after death, as opposed to remaining in a state of unconscious existence until the Last Judgment. Though some claim that he campaigned against the Immaculate Conception, this is far from clear. He engaged in long theological debates with other noted figures of the age such as William of Ockham and Meister Eckhart. Pope Benedict XII\\'s tomb, Cath��drale de Notre-Dame-des-Doms, Avignon [edit] Papal numbering A note on the numbering: Pope Benedict X is now considered an antipope. At the time, however, this status was not recognized and so the man the Roman Catholic church officially considers the tenth true Pope Benedict took the official number XI, rather than X. This has advanced the numbering of all subsequent Popes Benedict by one. Popes Benedict XI-XVI are, from an official point of view, the tenth through fifteenth popes by that name.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \\xa0\\xa0(Redirected from Ottobone) Jump to: navigation, search Adrian V Papacy began July 11, 1276 Papacy ended August 18, 1276 Predecessor Innocent V Successor John XXI Birth name Ottobuono de\\' Fieschi Born c. 1205 Genoa, Italy Died August 18, 1276 Viterbo, Italy Other popes named Adrian Pope Adrian V (c. 1205 ��� August 18, 1276), born Ottobuono de\\' Fieschi, was Pope in 1276. [edit] Biography Ottobuono belonged to a feudal family of Liguria, the Fieschi, Counts of Lavagna. His first clerical position came in 1243, when he was created a papal chaplain. In December 1251, he was created Cardinal Deacon of San Adriano by his uncle Pope Innocent IV (1243���54). He was, in addition, the archdeacon of Parma and Rheims. The dates are unknown for Parma, but it is known he became Archdeacon of Rheims in 1250. He was also archpriest of the patriarchal Liberian Basilica 1259-1276. Coat of Arms of Pope Adrian V. He was sent to England in 1265 by Pope Clement IV (1265���68) to mediate between Henry III of England (1216���72) and his barons, and to preach the Crusades; he remained there for several years as the papal legate, serving from October 1265 to July 1268. His diplomatic position was such that his name is still on the oldest extant piece of English statute law, the Statute of Marlborough of 1267, where the formal title mentions as a witness \\\\\"the Lord Ottobon, at that time legate in England\\\\\". (Also on this legation was a young diplomat, the future Boniface VIII.) In April 1268 he issued a set of canons, which formed the basis of church law in England until the reformation of the sixteenth century. Under the influence of Charles of Anjou, he was elected Pope to succeed Innocent V on July 12, 1276, but died at Viterbo on August 18, 1276 without ever having been ordained to the priesthood; he is buried there in the church of S.\\xa0Francesco. Technically, since Adrian V was never ordained bishop, he never truly became the Bishop of Rome, but traditionally he is counted in the papal succession. He achieved little during his time as Pope; he annulled Pope Gregory X\\'s (1271���76) bull on the holding of papal conclaves, but died before enacting new regulations. In the Divine Comedy Dante meets Adrian\\'s spirit in Purgatory, on the level reserved for the avaricious, where Adrian is atoning for his sin of worldly ambition.

The young L��nard learned in Hungarian[3] in the Royal Hungarian Gymnasium, and as he writes it in his autobiography this made a big impression on him (especially the personality of his teacher, Virgil Klatt). In 1880 he studied physics and chemistry in Wien and in Budapest[3]. In 1882 he left Budapest and returned to Pressburg but in 1883 L��n��rd moved to Heidelberg after his tender for an assistant job in the University of Budapest was refused. In Heidelberg he studied under the illustrious Robert Bunsen and Hermann von Helmholtz, and obtained his doctoral degree in 1886.[4] In 1887 he worked again in Budapest under Lor��nd E��tv��s as a demonstrator.[3] After posts at Aachen, Bonn, Breslau, Heidelberg (1896-1898), and Kiel (1898-1907), he returned finally to the University of Heidelberg in 1907 as the head of the Philipp Lenard Institute. In 1907 Philip L��n��rd became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences[3]. His early work included studies of phosphorescence and luminescence and the conductivity of flames. Currently both Hungarians and Germans consider the famous physicist as their own. He was born in the Kingdom of Hungary (which was the part of Austria-Hungary), in a city which had a mixed German-Hungarian population. He writes in his autobiography that he is a proud Hungarian, and there was only one lecture after physics what he loved: Hungarian literature (He also wrote that he loves the works of K��lcsey, V��r��smarty, Pet��fi and J��kai).[3] He also marked the signatures of his letters with the words \\\\\"Hazafias ��dv��zlettel\\\\\" (\\\\\"with patriotic regards\\\\\").[3] [edit] Contributions to physics [edit] Photoelectric investigation As a physicist, Lenard\\'s major contributions were in the study of cathode rays, which he began in 1888. Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive tubes which are partially evacuated glass tubes that have metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage can be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. Lenard overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated. He was able to conveniently detect the rays and measure their intensity by means of paper sheets coated with phosphorescent materials.[5] These windows have come to be known as Lenard windows. Lenard observed that the absorption of the rays was, to first order, proportional to the density of the material they were made to pass through. This appeared to contradict the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through some inches of air of a normal density, and appeared to be scattered by it, implying that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of J.J. Thomson\\'s work, which ultimately arrived at the understanding that cathode rays were streams of energetic electrons. In conjunction with his and other earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals, the general realization that electrons were constituent parts of the atom enabled Lenard to claim correctly that for the most part atoms consist of empty space. As a result of his Crookes tube investigations, he showed that the rays produced by radiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were similar in many respects to cathode rays. His most important observations were that the energy of the rays was independent of the light intensity, but was greater for shorter wavelengths of light. These latter observations were explained by Albert Einstein as a quantum effect. This theory predicted that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to Planck\\'s constant, h. This was shown to be the case some years later. The photo-electric quantum theory was the work cited when Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. This much embittered Lenard, who became a prominent skeptic of relativity and of Einstein\\'s theories generally. [edit] Meteorological contributions Lenard was the first person to study what has been termed the Lenard effect in 1892. This is the separation of electric charges accompanying the aerodynamic breakup of water drops. It is also known as spray electrification or the waterfall effect.[6] He conducted studies on the size and shape distributions of raindrops and constructed a novel wind tunnel in which water droplets of various sizes could be held stationary for a few seconds. He was the first to recognize that large raindrops are not tear-shaped, but are rather shaped something like a hamburger bun.[7] [edit] \\\\\"Deutsche Physik\\\\\" and anti-semitism Lenard is remembered today as a strong German nationalist who despised English physics, which he considered as having stolen their ideas from Germany. He joined the National Socialist Party before it became politically necessary or popular to do so. During the Nazi regime, he was the outspoken proponent of the idea that Germany should rely on \\\\\"Deutsche Physik\\\\\" and ignore what he considered the fallacious and deliberately misleading ideas of \\\\\"Jewish physics\\\\\", by which he meant chiefly the theories of Albert Einstein, including \\\\\"the Jewish fraud\\\\\" of relativity. An advisor to Adolf Hitler, Lenard became Chief of Aryan Physics under the Nazis. Lenard retired from Heidelberg University as professor of theoretical physics in 1931. He achieved emeritus status there, but he was expelled from his post by Allied occupation forces in 1945 when he was 83. He died in 1947 in Messelhausen.

��� May 20, 1947) was a Hungarian[2]-German physicist and the winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1905 for his research on cathode rays and the discovery of many of their properties. He was also an active proponent of Nazi ideology.

The young L��nard learned in Hungarian[3] in the Royal Hungarian Gymnasium, and as he writes it in his autobiography this made a big impression on him (especially the personality of his teacher, Virgil Klatt). In 1880 he studied physics and chemistry in Wien and in Budapest[3]. In 1882 he left Budapest and returned to Pressburg but in 1883 L��n��rd moved to Heidelberg after his tender for an assistant job in the University of Budapest was refused. In Heidelberg he studied under the illustrious Robert Bunsen and Hermann von Helmholtz, and obtained his doctoral degree in 1886.[4] In 1887 he worked again in Budapest under Lor��nd E��tv��s as a demonstrator.[3] After posts at Aachen, Bonn, Breslau, Heidelberg (1896-1898), and Kiel (1898-1907), he returned finally to the University of Heidelberg in 1907 as the head of the Philipp Lenard Institute. In 1907 Philip L��n��rd became a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences[3]. His early work included studies of phosphorescence and luminescence and the conductivity of flames. Currently both Hungarians and Germans consider the famous physicist as their own. He was born in the Kingdom of Hungary (which was the part of Austria-Hungary), in a city which had a mixed German-Hungarian population. He writes in his autobiography that he is a proud Hungarian, and there was only one lecture after physics what he loved: Hungarian literature (He also wrote that he loves the works of K��lcsey, V��r��smarty, Pet��fi and J��kai).[3] He also marked the signatures of his letters with the words \\\\\"Hazafias ��dv��zlettel\\\\\" (\\\\\"with patriotic regards\\\\\").[3] [edit] Contributions to physics [edit] Photoelectric investigation As a physicist, Lenard\\'s major contributions were in the study of cathode rays, which he began in 1888. Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive tubes which are partially evacuated glass tubes that have metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage can be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. Lenard overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated. He was able to conveniently detect the rays and measure their intensity by means of paper sheets coated with phosphorescent materials.[5] These windows have come to be known as Lenard windows. Lenard observed that the absorption of the rays was, to first order, proportional to the density of the material they were made to pass through. This appeared to contradict the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through some inches of air of a normal density, and appeared to be scattered by it, implying that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of J.J. Thomson\\'s work, which ultimately arrived at the understanding that cathode rays were streams of energetic electrons. In conjunction with his and other earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals, the general realization that electrons were constituent parts of the atom enabled Lenard to claim correctly that for the most part atoms consist of empty space. As a result of his Crookes tube investigations, he showed that the rays produced by radiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were similar in many respects to cathode rays. His most important observations were that the energy of the rays was independent of the light intensity, but was greater for shorter wavelengths of light. These latter observations were explained by Albert Einstein as a quantum effect. This theory predicted that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to Planck\\'s constant, h. This was shown to be the case some years later. The photo-electric quantum theory was the work cited when Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. This much embittered Lenard, who became a prominent skeptic of relativity and of Einstein\\'s theories generally. [edit] Meteorological contributions Lenard was the first person to study what has been termed the Lenard effect in 1892. This is the separation of electric charges accompanying the aerodynamic breakup of water drops. It is also known as spray electrification or the waterfall effect.[6] He conducted studies on the size and shape distributions of raindrops and constructed a novel wind tunnel in which water droplets of various sizes could be held stationary for a few seconds. He was the first to recognize that large raindrops are not tear-shaped, but are rather shaped something like a hamburger bun.[7] [edit] \\\\\"Deutsche Physik\\\\\" and anti-semitism Lenard is remembered today as a strong German nationalist who despised English physics, which he considered as having stolen their ideas from Germany. He joined the National Socialist Party before it became politically necessary or popular to do so. During the Nazi regime, he was the outspoken proponent of the idea that Germany should rely on \\\\\"Deutsche Physik\\\\\" and ignore what he considered the fallacious and deliberately misleading ideas of \\\\\"Jewish physics\\\\\", by which he meant chiefly the theories of Albert Einstein, including \\\\\"the Jewish fraud\\\\\" of relativity. An advisor to Adolf Hitler, Lenard became Chief of Aryan Physics under the Nazis. Lenard retired from Heidelberg University as professor of theoretical physics in 1931. He achieved emeritus status there, but he was expelled from his post by Allied occupation forces in 1945 when he was 83. He died in 1947 in Messelhausen.
